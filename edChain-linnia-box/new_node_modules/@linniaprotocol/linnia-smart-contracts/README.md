Smart Contracts for Linnia

# Overview
## Linnia Users
A contract that keeps a registry of registered users and their provenance.

## Linnia Records
A contract that keeps a registry of metadata of uploaded medical records, as well as the IRIS score of those records. The metadata makes records easily searchable.

# Recieving Tokens when adding Linnia records

When a person uploads data, 1 Finney LIN token is transferred from the Linnia admin pool/acct to the userâ€™s address.
Currently no data validation needed.

1 Finney of LIN tokens per upload for now.

## Linnia Permissions
A contract that keeps a registry of permissions. Permissions include who can view what data, and where the permissioned copy is stored on IPFS.
